# Hello-World
Time to get serious, I need to make a change and I feel like this is my chance at a better life for myself and my daughter.
I have spent the last 10 years working my way up the ladder of the resturant industy, in my hometown. By the time I was 26 I had become the Head Chef of my frist restaurant. Long days and even longer night led me to a quick burnout.
